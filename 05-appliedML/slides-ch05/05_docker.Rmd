# Docker 101?

# Motivation

Have you ever...

--

- tried to install a program or run someone else's code, only to be confronted by a bunch of error messages (missing packages, dependencies, etc.)?

--

- shared your code and data with someone else, only for _them_ to be confronted by a bunch of error messages (missing packages, dependencies, etc.)?

--

- re-run your _own_ code after updating some packages, only to find that it no longer works or the results have changed?

--

Containers are way to solve these and other common software problems.

# Docker


By far the most widely used and best supported container technology. While there are other container platforms around, when I talk about "containers" in this lecture, I'm really talking about [**Docker**](https://www.docker.com/).

# The "container" analogy

You know those big shipping containers used to transport physical goods?

.pull-left[
<img src="https://containerone.net/cdn/shop/articles/iStock-1284852950_2000x.jpg?v=1618859184"  width="60%">

]

They provide a standard format for transporting all kinds of goods (TVs, fresh produce, whatever). Moreover, they are stackable and can easily be switched between different transport modes (ship, road, rail).


---
# The "container" analogy

Docker containers are the software equivalent. 
- physical goods <-> software
- transport modes <-> operating systems

--

More importantly, it allows us to always run code from a predictable state:
- Standardized shape and form
- Everyone can use
- "If it runs on your machine, it will run on my machine."
---

# Why do we care?

### 1. Reproducibility

If we can bundle our code and software in a Docker container, then we don't have to worry about it not working on someone else's system (and vice versa). Similarly, we don't have to worry about it not working on our own systems in the future. 
- Examples of academic research projects using Docker [here](https://github.com/grantmcdermott/sceptic-priors) and [here](https://github.com/johnjosephhorton/wages_of_paycuts).

### 2. Deployment

There are many deployment scenarios (packaging, testing, etc.). Of particular interest to this course are data science pipelines where you want to deploy software quickly and reliably. 



---

# How it works

1. Start off with a stripped-down version of an operating system. Usually a Linux distro like Ubuntu.

2. Install _all_ of the programs and dependencies that are needed to run your code.

3. (Add any extra configurations you want.)

4. Package everything up as a [tarball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_%28computing%29).<sup>†</sup>

.footnote[
<sup>†</sup> A format for storing a bunch of files as a single object. Can also be compressed to save space.

**Summary:** Containers are like mini, portable operating systems that contain everything needed to run some piece of software (but nothing more!).

# What are Docker, Containers and Images?

<html><div style='float:left'></div><hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=1100px></html>
---
# Important Concepts

- **Docker** is a platform for building, running, and shipping applications. 

- **Containers** are lightweight, standalone, executable packages that contain everything needed to run an application, including the code, a runtime, libraries, environment variables, and config files.

- A **Docker Image** is a read-only file that contains all the necessary instructions for creating a container. They are used to create and start new containers at runtime.


--

Docker helps developers to package their applications together with the dependencies into a container, which can then run on any machine that has Docker installed.

# How are Docker containers different from Virtual Machines?

As soon as we defined containers, you’d wonder how it differs from virtual machines, as both technologies allow multiple isolated environments to run on the same physical machine. 

<div align="center">
<img src="https://images.datacamp.com/image/upload/v1674819870/Virtual_Machine_vs_Container_ea0b4b54a1.png"  width="55%">
</div>


---
# How are Docker containers different from Virtual Machines?
- Each virtual machine is an isolated environment that can run different operating systems and configurations. 
- It also means that each VM requires a full copy of the operating system, which can consume many resources. 
- Containerized application, on the other hand, runs in an isolated environment without requiring a full copy of the operating system, which makes them more lightweight and efficient.

--

While virtual machines are useful, containers are generally sufficient and ideal for shipping applications.

---
# Why Docker for Data Scientists/Economists?

- You probably are wondering why you should learn Docker as a data scientist/economists. 

- Aren’t there the DevOps teams to take care of the infrastructure side of things?

Fair question — but docker is extremely important for data scientists, even if there’s a DevOps team. Let’s understand why Docker is so useful.

# Installing Docker on your machine or local server

Docker is available for all major operating systems, such as Linux, Windows, and Mac. The installation is straightforward and best found in the official documentation.

- Instructions to install Docker for [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install)
- Instructions to install Docker for [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/).
- Instructions to install Docker for Windows (install varies by version)
  - [Windows 10 Pro / Education / Enterprise](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)
  - [Windows 10 Home](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install-windows-home/)
  - [Windows 7 / 8](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/)

If you’d like to create your own images and push them to Docker Hub (as shown in some of the below commands), you must create an account on Docker Hub. Think of [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) as a central place where developers can store and share their Docker images.

# Familiarizing with common Docker commands

<html><div style='float:left'></div><hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=1100px></html>
---

# Docker commands

To help you get started, we’ve outlined the ten most commonly used Docker commands you’re sure to encounter.

1. `docker run`: This command is used to run a container from an image. The -p flag maps a port on the host machine to a port on the container. For example, the following command will run a container from the "nginx" image and map port 80 on the host machine to port 80 on the container.

```bash
docker run -p 80:80 nginx
```
---
# Docker commands

2. `docker ps`: This command is used to list all running containers. This command is useful when we have several isolated containers running in the same machine.
```bash
docker ps
```
3. `docker stop`: This command is used to stop a running container.
```bash
docker stop <container_id>
```
4. `docker rm`: This command is used to remove a stopped container. 
```bash
docker rm <container_id>
```
---
# Docker commands
5. `docker images`: This command is used to list all images on the host machine. The command is useful to see the available local images before we run them to create a container.
```bash
docker images
```
6. `docker rmi`: This command is used to remove an image.
```bash
docker rmi <image_id>
```
7. `docker build`: This command is used to build an image from a Dockerfile. The -t flag specifies the name of the image and the . at the end specifies the build context, which is the current directory.
```bash
docker build -t my_image 
```

---
# Docker commands
8. `docker exec`: This command is used to run a command inside a running container.
```bash
docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/bash
```
9. `docker pull`: This command is used to pull an image from a registry, such as Docker Hub. 
```bash
docker pull <image_name>
```
10. `docker push`: This command is used to push an image to a registry.
```bash
docker push <image_name>
```

# Dockerizing a simple machine learning application
Dockerizing any machine learning application is easier than you think if you follow a simple three-step approach.

<div align="center">
<img src="https://images.datacamp.com/image/upload/v1674819869/Dockerizing_a_machine_learning_application_0b88e434ae.png"  width="65%">
</div>

# 1. Defining the environment

You need to know precisely the current environment to be able to replicate it in another location. The easiest (and the most common) way is to create requirements.txt file that outlines all the libraries your project is using, including their versions.

Here’s how the content of the file looks like:
```bash
scikit-learn==1.2.0
```

**Note**: A more complex machine learning application would utilize more libraries such as NumPy, pandas, matplotlib and others. Thus creating a `requirements.txt` file would make more sense instead of simply installing the library

---
# 2. Write a Dockerfile
Our next step is to create a file named Dockerfile that can create the environment and executes our application in it. 

In simpler terms, it’s like our instruction manual to Docker, mentioning what the environment should be, the contents, and other execution steps.

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9

WORKDIR /src

COPY requirements.txt .

RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

CMD ["python","iris_classification.py"]
```
---
# 3. Build the Image

The final step to create a reproducible environment is to create an image (also known as a template) which can be run to create any number of containers with the same configurations.

You can build the image by running the command docker `build -t <image-name>` . in the same directory where the Dockerfile is located.

Now that you have dockerized the simple machine learning application we saw, you can use the docker run command, create containers, and then stop them as required. We already covered some common commands earlier.
